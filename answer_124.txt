simulate mailserver failover:

To run backend tests and server:
java -jar build/libs/siteminder-test-0.1.0.jar --mailgun.apiKey=<INSERT MAILGUN API KEY> --sendgrid.apiKey=<INSERT SENDGRID API KEY HERE>

To simulate mailserver failover, we could run the backend with faike maigun api key or fake sendgrid api key.
Verify the result is same as two mail servers.
