Question 1& 2：

Answer:
Email Sender  GUi has 6 inputs:
1>To addresses
2>CC addresses
3>Bcc addresses
4> From
5> Subject
6> Text body


Test strategy:
a.Input 1, 4, 5, 6 are mandatory fields, one or more than ome of them are missing, there is different error message
b.Input 1, 2, 3, 4 are email address, there is email address validation, and will pop up error message "please include '@' in the email address" for invalid email address
c.Input 1, 2, 3 could be multiple values 

d. To simulate mailserver failover, we could run the backend with faike maigun api key or fake sendgrid api key. 



Mocha test cases: (build.test.js)

NOTE::::::::::::::::::::::  I did not add all the test cases into mocha js file, there could be more comobination accoring to the test stragety.
